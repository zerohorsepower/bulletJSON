# BulletJSON

BulletJSON is a project that aims to update and extend the original [BulletML](https://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/index_e.html) definition.

The [BulletML](https://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/index_e.html) was originally designed to easily allow the description of Danmaku patterns via XML, but focusing on arcade style shooters. BulletJSON aims to extend its functionalities to allow more "Touhou style" patterns in a easy way.

It also uses JSON instead of XML because no one uses XML anymore and JSON is more readable/portable.

For the complete definition and doc, read the DEFINITION.md and IMPLEMENTATION.md files.

A demo project + live editor can be found at gh-pages from this repository, its source code is inside `patter-editor` dir.

Most pattern examples are from [BulletMLExamples](https://github.com/dmanning23/BulletMLExamples).

The used sprites are from the game DoDonPachi Daiffukatsu, developed by CAVE. All rights reserved.
